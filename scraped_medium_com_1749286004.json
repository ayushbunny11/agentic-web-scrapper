      "He also pointed out that, as AI becomes embodied through robots that have AI brains, that the AIs will then “live in our world” and will develop their own experiences and develop the awareness of human situations — giving them human-like judgment.",
      "Elon Musk and now Trump know this. In fact, I believe that they are anticipating a global economic collapse. And if so, then they realize that time is short for them to get ahead of the situation personally. Perhaps that is why Trump wasted no time creating cryptocurrencies in his first day in office — something that most would consider to be unethical, since it is an attempt to personally and directly profit from his new office. But who cares? — the world is going to collapse, so get as rich as possible now, so that when the fall comes, you are among the richest billionaires who can then buy up all of the natural resources and live in an AI-powered enclave, safe from the starving masses.",
      "Perhaps that is why one of Trump’s first actions was to revoke Biden’s AI safety executive order.",
      "A collapse is what is coming. Sam Altman said clearly that they “know how to create AGI” (human-level artificial intelligence). This came sooner than expected, and so it means that the collapse is coming sooner than expected.",
      "When companies can use AI to do 90% of what humans do, why would they hire people?",
      "They won’t, except for the few remaining tasks that require human accountability; but those roles will migrate to partners and senior shareholders, and away from managers.",
      "And then guess what happens? All those companies that ditched human workers for AI agents? They now have no customers, because no one has a job. No job, no income. No income, no purchases.",
